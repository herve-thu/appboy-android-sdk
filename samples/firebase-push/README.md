# Firebase Push Sample

This sample app showcases our Firebase integration for push.

To get the sample working, you will need to create a Firebase project, add a `google-services.json` to the root of this sample project, and set your Firebase sender id in `res/values/strings.xml`. The package name is "com.appboy.firebasepush". 

For more information, see our [firebase push][1] documentation.
